# Hegelmote

This Go package and command utility allows remote control of Hegel amplifiers.
It connects using tcp to the address and port of the amplifier and allows sending commands to control parameters like power, input and volume.

The idea for this stems from wishing to create a free and open source alternative to [Hegel Remote](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/hegel-remote/id1562489978). It also supports more devices than the official [Hegel Control app](https://support.hegel.com/product-articles/hegel-setup-app).

While limited in functionality at the moment, the goal is to expand with better cli and gui offerings in the future.

## Supported Amplifiers

This software has only been tested on Hegel H95 but the list of supported models should be as follows:

- RÃ¶st
- H95
- H120
- H190
